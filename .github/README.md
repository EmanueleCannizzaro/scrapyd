## Setup Requirements

### Repository Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

#### Required for Docker & Release
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username (optional, for README sync)
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token (optional)

#### Required for Cloud Run Deployment
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud Project ID
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Service account JSON key with Cloud Run permissions

#### Optional for Enhanced Features
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov upload token for coverage reports

### Repository Variables

Configure these variables for Cloud Run deployment:

- `GCP_REGION`: Google Cloud region (e.g., `us-central1`)
- `CLOUDRUN_SERVICE_NAME`: Cloud Run service name

### Branch Protection

Recommended branch protection rules for `master`:

```yaml
Protection Rules:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required status checks:
  - Code Quality & Linting
  - Unit Tests (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
  - Integration Tests
  - Package Build Test
  - Docker Build Test
```

- **Build caching**: GitHub Actions cache for faster builds

### Release Workflow Process

1. **Tag Validation**: Semantic version validation
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite execution
3. **Package Building**: Python package creation and validation
4. **Release Creation**: GitHub release with automated notes
5. **Distribution**: PyPI publishing (stable) or TestPyPI (pre-release)

## Usage Examples

### Manual Deployment

Deploy to staging:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Deploy to Cloud Run ‚Üí Run workflow
# Select: staging environment
```

Deploy to production:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Deploy to Cloud Run ‚Üí Run workflow
# Select: production environment
```

### Release Process

Create a new release:
```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
# Automated release workflow triggers
```

### Security Scan

Run manual security scan:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Security & Dependency Updates ‚Üí Run workflow
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Workflow Status

Monitor workflow health:
- Check Actions tab for recent runs
- Review security scan results in Security tab
- Monitor deployment status in Environments tab

### Dependency Updates

- Automated PRs created daily for dependency updates
- Review and merge dependency update PRs regularly
- Security vulnerabilities trigger immediate notifications

### Performance Monitoring

- Performance tests run on master branch commits
- Benchmark results stored as artifacts
- Compare performance across releases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Failed Tests**: Review test logs in Actions tab
2. **Docker Build Failures**: Check Dockerfile and dependencies
3. **Deployment Failures**: Verify GCP credentials and permissions
4. **Security Scan Failures**: Review security scan artifacts

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding these secrets:
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`: `true`
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG`: `true`

### Manual Intervention

For critical issues:
1. Use `workflow_dispatch` triggers for manual runs
2. Use `force_deploy` option for emergency deployments
3. Monitor rollback procedures in Cloud Run console

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Ensure all CI checks pass before creating PR
3. Review security scan results
4. Test Docker builds locally before pushing

### Release Management

1. Use semantic versioning for tags
2. Test releases in staging environment first
3. Monitor deployment health after production releases
4. Keep release notes updated

### Security

1. Regularly review security scan results
2. Update dependencies promptly
3. Monitor for new vulnerabilities
4. Keep secrets and tokens secure

This comprehensive GitHub Actions setup provides enterprise-grade CI/CD capabilities for the Scrapyd project with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment workflows.
